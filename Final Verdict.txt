2Ô∏è‚É£ Which Embedding is Better?
‚úÖ Winner: Cohere Embeddings üéâ

Cohere embeddings consistently outperformed Hugging Face embeddings across all queries, showing higher precision, recall, F1-score, and cosine similarity.

Higher Cosine Similarity: Cohere embeddings achieved an average similarity of 0.87, while Hugging Face averaged 0.83.
Better Context Understanding: Cohere embeddings captured financial terms more effectively, leading to better document retrieval.
Improved Precision & Recall: Higher F1-scores indicate that Cohere embeddings retrieved more relevant content with less noise.



3Ô∏è‚É£ Example: "Explain liquidity risk in banking"
Model	Generated Answer
Cohere	"Liquidity risk refers to the risk that a bank will not be able to meet its short-term financial obligations. It arises when a bank's assets are illiquid or there is a sudden withdrawal of funds."
Hugging Face	"Liquidity risk occurs when a bank does not have enough liquid assets. It is important for banks to manage liquidity to ensure they can meet deposit withdrawals and payment obligations."
üîπ Why Cohere is better?

More comprehensive explanation
Captured "short-term financial obligations" (a key concept)
Used specific terminology that aligns with financial definitions


4Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion
üéØ Cohere embeddings provide better accuracy, context understanding, and retrieval quality.
If you're working on finance-related NLP applications, Cohere is the best choice for embedding generation. üöÄ
